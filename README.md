## 🚀 Running My portfolio website locally
Let's setup locally. First, you need to download this source code 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EssiJunior/my-portfolio.git
# Open a terminal and paste this code to download this code
```


## ⚙️ Setting Up The Development Environment
This code was written using [React - JavaScript library](https://react.dev/). Below are the instructions to follow to run our application locally.

### → `STEP #0`

> Make sure you have node 16 or above installed on your machine. Take a look at the [official guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for installation. After installation, run the following command in your terminal for a double check.

##### node v16.0.0 or above ( Expected result )
```sh
node --version
```

### `→ STEP #1`
> Open this code in your favorite code editor. We recommend you [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### `→ STEP #2`
Install the project's dependencies found in the *_package.json_* file
##### note that the --legacy-peer-deps flag is used to resolve dependency conflicts that can overcome

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

The command will take a while depending upon your internet speed.

### `→ STEP #3`
Launch server  

```sh
npm run dev
```
Available at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)<br><hr>


`That's it! 🥂`


### `→ OTHERS`

### `build to production`

```sh
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
